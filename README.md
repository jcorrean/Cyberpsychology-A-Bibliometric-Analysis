# Cyberpsychology-A-Bibliometric-Analysis
This repository is intended to guide other researchers who want to replicate the results of our manuscript titled: "Cyberpsychology: A bibliometric analysis". The preprint of this work is available at https://psyarxiv.com/prfcw/.
NOTE: Due to memory limits in GitHub, the last dataset with all the bibliographic records of cyberbehavior from 2000 to 2018 are available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1McvsgonjQ_N0h_tNJ1-EHWzbUZ8ZMMMh/view?usp=sharing 

The majority of Figures can be easily reproduced by running the codes in the scripts provided here. Our Figure 2, however, is reproducible by running the Biblioshiny option "collaboration network" year by year, and merging the resulting world maps into one single Figure (out of R).
